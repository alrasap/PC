# Program Overview

This program is created by Rohan Singh, Student Number: 931006 from TL Kennedy Secondary School. It is designed to perform basic coding tasks, explained step-by-step with simple comments.

## Purpose
This program was made as part of my school project. It demonstrates the basic usage of Python code, including loops, conditionals, and variables. This code was created after watching a tutorial and working on it myself.

## Pseudo Code
1. Start the program.
2. Set up a variable with a value.
3. Use a loop to repeat a task.
4. Make decisions using conditions.
5. Print output to the screen.
6. End the program.

## File Structure
- Each file should be inside its own folder/directory.
- This directory contains the Python code and this README.md file.

## Success Criteria
- Proper file naming conventions (no spaces, filenames start with a number).
- The directory structure is organized properly with separate folders for each file.
- Every Python file includes comments explaining each block of code.

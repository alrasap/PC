/*
  ✅ PROJECT GOAL:
  - Detect a car using an ultrasonic sensor.
  - Open gate automatically using a servo motor.

  ✅ WHAT THIS CODE DOES:
  - Reads distance using HC-SR04.
  - If distance < 6 cm, the servo rotates to 90° to open the gate.
  - Otherwise, it stays closed.

  ✅ HOW IT MEETS THE GOAL:
  - Uses simple components and logic.
  - Automatically reacts to real-time sensor input.
  - Tested multiple times for consistent behavior.

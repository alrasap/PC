### Instructions:
1. Run the program.
2. The program starts by showing an initial list of tasks: `['write email', 'finish homework', 'call mom', 'clean room']`.
3. The program removes the task `'call mom'` and updates the list, showing the change.
4. Then, it removes the task `'clean room'` and prints the updated list again.
5. After that, you will be prompted with the question: "Would you like to continue (yes/no)?"
   - If you type **yes**, it will thank you and suggest you continue modifying or checking your list.
   - If you type **no**, it will say goodbye.

### Example Output:
```python
Original list: ['write email', 'finish homework', 'call mom', 'clean room']

List after removing 'call mom': ['write email', 'finish homework', 'clean room']

Final list after removing 'clean room': ['write email', 'finish homework']

Would you like to continue (yes/no)? yes

Thank you for using the list remover program!
You can now continue modifying or checking your list.

## Sets vs Lists

### Purpose:
This Python program compares how lists and sets behave in Python. It shows that lists can contain duplicate elements, while sets automatically remove duplicates. The program allows users to experiment with their own lists and see how the conversion works.

### Requirements:
* Python 3.x or above

### Instructions:
1. Run the program in your Python environment.
2. You will first see a list with some duplicate numbers.
3. The program will automatically convert the list into a set, removing any duplicates, and display both the list and the set.
4. You will be asked if you want to try again with a different list.
   * If you choose "yes", enter a new list of numbers separated by commas (e.g., `1, 2, 2, 3`).
   * If you choose "no", the program will exit.

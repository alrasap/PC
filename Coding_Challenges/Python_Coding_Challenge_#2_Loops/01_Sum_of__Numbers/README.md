# Sum of Numbers Program

## Description
The **01_sum_of_numbers.py** program takes a number `n` as input from the user and calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop. The program adds up all the integers starting from 1 until the entered number `n` and outputs the result.

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how a `for` loop can be used to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number. It can be used to understand basic loops, user input, and arithmetic operations in Python.

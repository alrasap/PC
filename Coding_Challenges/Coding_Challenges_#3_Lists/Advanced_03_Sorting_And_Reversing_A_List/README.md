# Sorting and Reversing a List Program

### Purpose:
This Python program demonstrates how to work with lists by allowing the user to:
- Sort the list of fruits alphabetically (ascending order)
- Reverse the list to show it in descending order
- Add new fruits to the list

The program is designed to interact with the user and show the list before and after sorting or reversing, along with allowing them to add new items to the list. It's a great introduction to basic list operations in Python.

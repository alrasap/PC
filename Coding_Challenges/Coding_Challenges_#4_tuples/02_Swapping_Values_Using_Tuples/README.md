## Swapping Values Using Tuples

### Purpose:
This Python program demonstrates how to swap the values of two numbers using tuples. 
The program asks the user to input two numbers, stores them in a tuple, 
and swaps their values without using a temporary variable. 
After swapping, the program will display the swapped values.

The program will continue running until the user decides to stop.

Welcome to the Value Swapping Program!
This program swaps the values of two numbers using tuples.

Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 10

Swapped values: 10 and 5

Would you like to swap another pair of values? (yes/no): yes

Enter first number: 20
Enter second number: 30

Swapped values: 30 and 20

Would you like to swap another pair of values? (yes/no): yes

Enter first number: -5
Enter second number: 100

Swapped values: 100 and -5

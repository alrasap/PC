## **Tuple Operations & Count**

### Purpose:
This Python program asks the user to input the name of a fruit, and then counts how many times that fruit appears in a predefined tuple of fruits. The program ensures that the user inputs a valid fruit, and if an invalid input is provided, it prompts the user until they enter a valid fruit. It's designed to help the user understand how tuples work and how to count specific items within them using the `count()` method.

### Requirements:

### Instructions:
1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, enter the name of a fruit (e.g., "apple", "banana", "cherry").
3. The program will check if the entered fruit is in the predefined tuple and count how many times it appears.
4. If the fruit is not in the tuple, the program will ask the user to enter a valid fruit name.
5. After checking the fruit, the program will ask if you want to check another fruit. Enter "yes" to continue or "no" to exit.

### Example Interaction:
```python
Welcome to the Fruit Counter program!
Enter a fruit name (e.g., 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'): hfbg
Sorry, 'hfbg' is not in the tuple.
Please enter a valid fruit name (e.g., 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'): banana
'banana' appears 2 times in the tuple.
Would you like to check another fruit? (yes/no): no
Thank you for using the Fruit Counter program! Goodbye!
